# Tracing knowledge about plants of and from Sri Lanka

The tropical regions of the Indian Ocean are rich in biodiversity and historically important spaces for knowledge production and circulation. European imperialism and colonisation had led to extensive extraction of materials and dispersal of knowledge – knowledge that are today stored in European repositories, separated from their origins and from each other. 

This project re-connects digital sources to reconstruct an understanding of the historical environment of Sri Lanka as an island.
